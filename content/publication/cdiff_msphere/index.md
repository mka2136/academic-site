abstract: ! "*Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI) has a higher incidence in solid organ transplant recipients than other hospitalized patients and can lead to poor outcomes. Perturbations to the intestinal microbiome are common in patients undergoing liver transplant (LT); however, the impacts of microbial diversity and composition on risk of CDI in this patient population is incompletely understood. Here, we assessed patients in an established, longitudinal LT cohort for development of CDI within 1 year of transplant. Clinical data were compared for patients with and without CDI using univariable models. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was performed at multiple pre- and posttransplant time points to compare microbiome ??- and ??-diversity and enrichment of specific taxa in patients with and without CDI. Of 197 patients who underwent LT, 18 (9.1%) developed CDI within 1 year. Pre-LT Child-Pugh class C liver disease, postoperative biliary leak, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics were significantly associated with CDI. Patients who developed CDI had significantly lower ??-diversity than patients without CDI overall and in samples collected at months 1, 3, and 6. Microbial composition (??-diversity) differed between patients with and without CDI and across sampling time points, particularly later in their posttransplant course. We also identified 15 (8%) patients with toxigenic *C. difficile* colonization who did not develop CDI and may have had additional protective factors. In summary, clinical and microbiome factors are likely to converge to impart CDI risk. Along with enhanced preventive measures, there may be a role for microbiome modulation to restore microbial diversity in high-risk LT patients. <br><br><strong>Importance</strong><br><br>Liver transplant (LT) recipients have high rates of *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI), which has been associated with poor outcomes, including graft-related complications and mortality, in prior studies. Susceptibility to CDI is known to increase following perturbations in intestinal commensal bacteria that enable germination of *C. difficile* spores and bacterial overgrowth. In LT patients, changes in the intestinal microbiome resulting from advanced liver disease, surgery, and other clinical factors is common and most pronounced during the early posttransplant period. However, the relationship between microbiome changes and CDI risk after LT remains unclear. In this study, we investigated clinical and microbiome factors associated with development of CDI within the first year after LT. The importance of this work is to identify patients with high-risk features that should receive enhanced preventive measures and may benefit from the study of novel strategies to reconstitute the intestinal microbiome after LT."
